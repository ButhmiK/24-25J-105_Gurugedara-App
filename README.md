Project Overview:

This mobile application is developed as solution for the students with Dyslexia and Dyscalculia in primary schools from grade one to five in Sri lanka. It is expected to improve their basic Sinhala, Mathematics and social skills in order to give the ability of continuing their education on their own afterward. The child's severity status and the status of hardship in learning is identified first and then they were guided through special education procedure. Then they will be evaluated and graded based on their performance considered to the first step. These whole procedure will be devided into four components.
The main problem we discovered is the inability of understandin these children and the lack of facilities in improving their education physically. Therefore this app is build focused on primary school students as a solution for the all the questions we have fuond.

1. Identify and Analyze the disability (IT21352676-Sasanka S.G.H.K)
	Here we will evaluate student's knowledge as a beginner and identify which level they are currently on. The kid's difficulties and their severity will be identified and guided on which path they need take in further studies and what need to be prioratized. 

2. Implement Sinhala module and Evaluateprogress (IT21223426-Chamodi W.A.K.D)
	In this component child will get the opportunity of learning Sinhala letters along with identifying and differenciating them. They also get to learn object in nature and identify animals and their sounds. After that they will get to learn simple words, how to build them and read them. They will be evaluated considered to their performance. 

3. Implement Mathematics module and evaluate progress (IT21229770-L.P.A.Thushantha)
	In this component child will learn to identify and differenciate numbers. They will get to learn how to write them step by step guiding tutorials. Along with that they will learn different shapes, colors and mathematical objects relatively. The kids will also get the opportunity of learning how to do simple mathematical calculations. They will be evaluated considered to their performance.

4. Interpersonal developmemt management (IT21290442-Wickramasinghe B.K)
	In this section every child will get to improve their social and interpersobal skills. They will learn how to interact in different situations and conversations. Each time kid will get practiced and evaluated on their understanding and performance. As a futher support an AI chatbot is developed to help them in practicing everyday conversations. The kid's frequent emotion changes will be indentified along with the progress evaluation. This will be supportive in helping the kid similar activities.
